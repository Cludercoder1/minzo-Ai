# AI Models Directory

This directory will store trained AI models and learning data:

- `pattern-models/` - Pattern recognition models
- `classification/` - Topic classification models  
- `nlp-models/` - Natural language processing models
- `knowledge-graphs/` - Connected knowledge representations
- `learning-history/` - Training history and metrics

The self-learning AI will automatically create and update these models as it learns from user interactions.
